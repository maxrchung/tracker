This is a simple tracking/logging app that lets you enter entries and see changes over time. I made this mostly to experiment with [Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/react/) and try out a full Amplify frontend/backend deployed project. It's pretty cool. Some other stuff worth mentioning that I'm trying out: [Cloudscape](https://cloudscape.design), [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

To be honest it's probably too barebones as it is. You are forced to provide a value for all your entries so we can numerically keep track of changes. I did this just to lower the scope. Originally I wanted to allow you to arbitrarily create your own categories. Maybe I'll work on this another time. For now I'll deploy this as is and move onto the next thing.
